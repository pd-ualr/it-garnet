        <!-- rest of the content-->
        <p>
          The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities
          in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations
          and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and
          religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by
          the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and
          fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer
          tutoring, student government association, student support programs
          including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a
          student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life.

            enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational,
            entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities
            that are not available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]</q

        <h4>Athletics</h4>

        <p>
          UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock
          Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt
          Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not
          sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last
          fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock
          Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the
          Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:

            sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019,
